| Background | Previous research efforts had highlighted the importance of modeling cross-document relations in multi-document summarization. Those relations were also proved to be useful in identifying the salient and redundant information from long documents, and can thus guide
the summary generation process. However, while
effective empirically, such approaches do not focus on explicitly modeling the underlying semantic
information across documents.
Entities and their mentions convey rich semantic
information, and can be significant in summarization, especially when a specific entity is the topic
under discussion for a set of documents. As shown
in Figure 1, entity mentions frequently appear in
the input article, and are playing unique roles that
contribute towards the coherence and conciseness
of the text. We believe that entities can be regarded
