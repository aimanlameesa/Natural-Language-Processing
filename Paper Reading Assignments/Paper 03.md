| Aim | Zhou et al. presented an entity-aware model for abstractive multi-document summarization using a novel decoding mechanism that aims to deal with saliency and redundancy issues explicitly. |

| Background | Previous research efforts had highlighted the importance of modeling cross-document relations in multi-document summarization. Those relations were also proved to be effective in identifying the salient and redundant information, which can further help us to process summary generation from long documents. However, previous research in this domain did not focus on modeling the underlying semantic information across multiple documents explicitly. Since entity mentions convey rich semantic and contribute towards the coherence and conciseness of the text, they can be very significant in summary generation process. Considering entities as the indicator of saliency and reducing redundancy, Zhou et al. proposed an entity-aware abstractive multi-document summarization model to emphasize the relations of the entities across multiple documents. |

| Limitations | The limitation of this research is that the model heavily relies on the quality of entity annotations and may not generalize well to new domains with limited annotated data. |  
| Future Work | The future research direction includes exploring other approaches, i.e, reinforcement learning based methods to further improve the summary generation process for multiple documents. and also applying the proposed method to different tasks such as multi-document question answering.
