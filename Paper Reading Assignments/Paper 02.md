| Aim |  Moro et al. proposed a novel framework to discriminate critical information from a cluster of topic-related medical documents and generate a multi-document summary. |

| Background | The previous studies focused on mainly two approaches : (1) hierarchical networks capturing cross-document relations via graph encodings and (2) long-range neural models carrying out multi-input concatenation. But these approaches struggled to handle clusters of topic-related documents with low computational resources. Moreover, the pre-trained Transformers used to perform well in downstream tasks such as single-document summarization. Since processing a multi-document summary requires to have high capabilities to discriminate the correct information from the clusters merge them consistently, Moro et al. introduced a discriminative marginalized probabilistic neural method (DAMEN) to address this problem. |
