## Code Generator (using Transformer)

We used Flask to create a web-based automatic code generator given a few words of code. For this application, one has to input a few words of code from the beginning and then the program will automatically predict the latter words of code.

For this Language Modeling task, we used a Decoder to predict the next words in a sequence. Then we created the necassary frontend using html to display the process in a web application. We used "requirements.txt" file which contains all the necessary libraries, created "app.py" to apply Flask and pass the necessary function in the application.

A few screenshots from the web application are attached below:
