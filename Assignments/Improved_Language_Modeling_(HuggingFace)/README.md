## Improved_Language_Modeling_(HuggingFace)

We used Flask to create a web-based automatic code generator given a few words of code. For this application, one has to input a few words of code from the beginning and then the program will automatically predict the latter words of code.

For this Language Modeling task, we used pretrained GPT2 from HuggigFace to predict the next words in a sequence. Then we created the necassary frontend using html to display the process in a web application. We used "requirements.txt" file which contains all the necessary libraries, created "app.py" to apply Flask and pass the necessary function in the application.

A few screenshots from the web application are attached below:
